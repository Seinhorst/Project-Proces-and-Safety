Risk assessment
This document provides a risk assessment for an automated coupling assembly system utilizing an ABB IRB 1100 robot and three 12-volt motors. The objective is to identify potential risks associated with electrical, mechanical, and software-related aspects and formulate appropriate safety measures. The aim is to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the system in industrial production environments.

Electrical risks

Open terminals:
Open terminals can lead to electrical shock due to the increased likelihood of accidental contact. Open terminals may also result in unintended contact between conductors causing short circuits or lead to electrical fires. To reduce these risks there will be proper insulation materials used, covers over to shield the terminals to prevent accidental contract, the use of warning labels to clearly alert individuals about potential electrical hazards.

Damaged wiring: 
Damaged wiring can lead to electrical shock when working on the system due to the exposure of the wires. Damaged wiring is also a fire hazard because short circuits or overheating can result in electrical fires. To reduce these risks there shall be regular inspections to identify and replace damaged or worn-out wiring. By applying insulation on critical parts of the assembly there will be a reduced chance of worn-out wires.

Electrical overload:
Electrical overload may result into damaged components due to is exceeding the designed capacity, it may also result in electrical fires by overheating the components to reduce this risk is the use of circuit breakers or other current protection devices necessary to interrupt the flow of electricity in case of overload.
Component failure:
Unexpected failure of electrical components such as the robots motors can lead to system failure and unsafe conditions to mitigate this risk continuous monitoring whall be implemented
